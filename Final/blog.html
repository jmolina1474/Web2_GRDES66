            <img src="Blog1.jpeg" alt="HOLA-college-students" class="small-IMG">
            <p class="par2">For the first time ever, this year Heart of Los Angeles is distributing over $1,000,000 in college scholarships; providing invaluable support to students like HOLA alumni, Brayan, who graduated college this spring. Our scholarships give students the chance to attend school debt-free, an opportunity which for many can change the course of their life. The reality is that our students need more than a check to help them achieve their potential.   </p>

            <img src="Blog2.png" alt="newpaper-about-HOLA" class="small-IMG">
            <p class="par2">To say that Quarantunes x HOLA hosted by Richard and Demi Weitz was a success is a major understatement. The event marked the culmination of our Where the Heart Is virtual campaign and celebrated our continued work during the pandemic. We raised more than $460,000 towards our goal of $500,000. For those of you who missed it, we had amazing performances by so many incredible artists including Ziggy Marley, Juanes, Prince Royce, Chicago, Charlie Puth, Cherrelle, Kool and the Gang, War and Treaty, The Outfield and Jody Watley. It was definitely a night to remember.</p>

            <img src="Blog3.jpg" alt="Kids-thankng-workers" class="small-IMG">
            <p class="par2">Among our efforts to virtually engage youth and bring the arts into their homes, Heart of Los Angeles is facilitating an exciting mural design contest in partnership with CEMEX and the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles to express gratitude through art for essential workers, particularly our California farmworkers. HOLA hosted two workshops led by teaching artists Marlene Nancy Lopez to help inspire potential mural designs. Visual arts students learned about community murals and how they can express gratitude to essential workers. As part of the class, they were asked questions like, “How do you show your gratitude? What kind of gift would you give an essential worker to express that gratitude? What sort of meal would give an essential worker?” They were also taught about different iconography and imagery found in murals made for farmworkers and people in the food service industry. As part of the partnership, food and meals will be given out to essential workers delivered by a CEMEX truck and in partnership with Power of One.
